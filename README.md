## 🌟 One Song, One Style

Every song in the archive is treated as a unique visual performance. We move beyond static text to create a digital atmosphere that resonates with the music's soul.

| Song Example | Visual Identity | Key Techniques |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shiny Stories** | ✨ Iridescent Glassmorphism | Backdrop filters, frosted glass layers, dynamic gradients. |
| **Sunfaded** | 🎞️ Nostalgic Film Grain | CSS noise textures, sepia-toned overlays, serif typography. |
| **Overexposed** | 💡 Ethereal Bloom | High-contrast lighting, glow effects, motion-blurred reveals. |
